# to-do-list
I have to build a TODO List app.
In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks.
The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.
I can add a due date, a category and priority to each task .
By using Add Task Button I can add the task in database and we can see the output on screen as well.
By using Delete Task Button I can delete the task from database by clicking on the checkbox of paticular task and then clicking on delete task button.Also changes will be reflected on the screen.
